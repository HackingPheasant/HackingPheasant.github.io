## Build Site Locally
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Update syntax highlighting css
Since I don't include css for syntax highlighting, we can just manually generate GitHub's syntax highlighting CSS and add it to your project.
```bash
$ rougify style github > _sass/syntax-styles.scss
```
